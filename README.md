After a few years working as a developer, I always wondered how my source code actually runs on a computer.
I searched for the answer on Google, and I found a Reddit post. One comment suggested that anyone curious like me should try Nand2Tetris.

And boom! Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan became are the good teachers. I finally understood what really makes my source code run.

In this repo, Iâ€™ll upload my source code from the Nand2Tetris course. In the future, I hope to build a real Nand2Tetris hardware version! :)
